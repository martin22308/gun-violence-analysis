# Gun Violence Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing gun violence incidents to better understand patterns, trends, and key factors related to gun-related crimes.  
The analysis is purely **exploratory (EDA)** and aims to extract insights from the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the overall scale of gun violence incidents
- Analyze trends over time
- Compare incidents across states and cities
- Identify patterns in casualties (killed vs injured)
- Explore relationships between different features in the dataset

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains records of gun violence incidents, including information such as:
- Date of incident
- State and city
- Number of people killed
- Number of people injured
- Total victims
- Additional contextual attributes

> Note: Categorical features were kept as-is during the analysis phase (no encoding), as the focus is on understanding the data rather than modeling.
